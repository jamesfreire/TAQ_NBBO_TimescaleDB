# **Processing 440mm Daily Records with Nanosecond Precision in TimescaleDB**

## **Introduction**

TAQ data represents every trade and quote from all US regulated exchanges, distributed by the Securities Information Processors (SIPs). The NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) component specifically captures the best available bid and offers prices across all exchanges for each security at every moment during trading hours. This data is absolutely critical for market microstructure analysis, best execution analysis, and algorithmic trading research.

Unlike real-time market data feeds, TAQ data is delivered as comprehensive historical files for trades, quotes, and NBBO. This data typically becomes available after market close. In particular we will be examining the import of NBBO data into [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb). Each daily NBBO file typically contains approximately 440,000,000 quote records with nanosecond precision timestamps representing the complete National Best Bid and Offer activity for that trading day.

The challenge isn’t just the volume—it is also the time precision requirements. Financial regulations demand nanosecond timestamp accuracy for trade reconstruction and best execution analysis, but PostgreSQL only supports microsecond precision in TIMESTAMPTZ. Add to this the complex NBBO data structure that includes both individual exchange quotes and consolidated best bid/offer information, and you have a fascinating dataset.

## **The Technical Challenge**

### **Understanding NBBO Data Complexity**

NBBO data is more complex than simple trades or quotes. Each record represents a quote update that potentially changed the National Best Bid and Offer, and contains:

* The triggering quote: The specific exchange quote that caused the NBBO update  
* Current NBBO: The resulting best bid and offer across all exchanges  
* Exchange attribution: Which exchanges are currently setting the best bid and offer  
* Regulatory indicators: LULD (Limit Up-Limit Down) status, short sale restrictions, etc.

Here’s what a typical NBBO record structure looks like:

```

Time: 143015123456789    # 14:30:15.123456789 (HHMMSSxxxxxxxxx format)
Exchange: P              # NYSE Arca (triggering exchange)
Symbol: AAPL             # Apple Inc.
Bid_Price: 150.25        # Current quote from this exchange
Offer_Price: 150.26      # Current quote from this exchange
Best_Bid_Price: 150.26   # NBBO best bid across all exchanges
Best_Offer_Price: 150.27 # NBBO best offer across all exchanges
Best_Bid_Exchange: N     # NYSE is setting the best bid
Best_Offer_Exchange: Q   # NASDAQ is setting the best offer

```

### **The Pain Points**

When I started this project, several challenges became immediately apparent:

1\. Timestamp Format Complexity  
TAQ timestamps use a unique `HHMMSSxxxxxxxxx` format where HHMMSS represents hours, minutes, and seconds since midnight, followed by 9 digits for nanoseconds. This isn’t a standard UNIX timestamp—it requires custom parsing and validation.

2\. Volume and Performance Requirements  
Processing 440m NBBO records daily demands sustained high-throughput ingestion while maintaining query responsiveness for analysis. A single day’s data load needed to complete within a reasonable timeframe to have data ready for next-day analysis.

3\. Data Preprocessing Challenges  
TAQ files arrive without date columns—only intraday timestamps. The actual date must be extracted from filenames and injected into each record. The files also include headers and footers that need to be stripped.

4\. Query Pattern Optimization  
Financial analysis requires efficient access across multiple dimensions:

* Time-range queries for intraday analysis  
* Symbol-based lookups for single-stock studies  
* Cross-sectional analysis for market-wide snapshots at specific times

## **Discovery and Evaluation Process**

Initially, I evaluated several approaches:

* Traditional RDBMS: PostgreSQL with standard partitioning struggled with the write throughput requirements.  
* Specialized time-series databases: InfluxDB had limitations with the complex relational nature of NBBO data. KDB is standard for this type of data, but the pricing is out of reach to most.  
* TimescaleDB: PostgreSQL extension with time-series optimizations, familiar SQL interface, and proven financial data performance.

TimescaleDB stood out for several critical reasons:

* Native PostgreSQL compatibility with familiar SQL interface  
* Automatic partitioning optimized for time-series data  
* Excellent compression ratios for historical data  
* Strong analytical query performance  
* Mature ecosystem with financial industry adoption

### **Testing Methodology**

I created benchmarks using one day of [historical NBBO data](https://ftp.nyse.com/Historical%20Data%20Samples/DAILY%20TAQ/) (approximately 40 billion records) and measured:

* Daily file processing throughput and completion times  
* Query response times for common analysis patterns  
* End-to-end processing time from raw TAQ files to queryable data  
* All testing was done locally on a Macbook Pro M3

## **Schema Design Deep Dive**

The heart of this project was designing an optimal schema for TimescaleDB that could handle nanosecond precision while providing excellent query performance.

### **Core Table Design**

```

CREATE TABLE taq_nbbo (
    -- Import and data tracking
    import_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    data_date DATE NOT NULL,  -- Date extracted from filename
    
    -- Core timestamp and identification  
    time BIGINT NOT NULL,     -- TAQ format: HHMMSSxxxxxxxxx
    exchange CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    symbol VARCHAR(17) NOT NULL,
    
    -- Quote data (current exchange quote that triggered NBBO change)
    bid_price DECIMAL(12,6),
    bid_size INTEGER,
    offer_price DECIMAL(12,6),
    offer_size INTEGER,
    quote_condition CHAR(1),
    sequence_number BIGINT NOT NULL,
    
    -- NBBO indicators and metadata
    national_bbo_indicator CHAR(1),
    finra_bbo_indicator CHAR(1),
    finra_adf_mpid_indicator SMALLINT,
    quote_cancel_correction CHAR(1),
    source_of_quote CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    
    -- Best Bid information (consolidated NBBO)
    best_bid_quote_condition CHAR(1),
    best_bid_exchange CHAR(1),
    best_bid_price DECIMAL(12,6),
    best_bid_size INTEGER,
    best_bid_finra_market_maker_id CHAR(4),
    
    -- Best Offer information (consolidated NBBO)
    best_offer_quote_condition CHAR(1),
    best_offer_exchange CHAR(1),
    best_offer_price DECIMAL(12,6),
    best_offer_size INTEGER,
    best_offer_finra_market_maker_id CHAR(4),
    
    -- LULD and regulatory indicators
    luld_bbo_indicator CHAR(1),
    nbbo_luld_indicator CHAR(1),
    sip_generated_message_identifier CHAR(1),
    
    -- Timestamps (in TAQ HHMMSSxxxxxxxxx format)
    participant_timestamp BIGINT,
    finra_adf_timestamp BIGINT,
    
    -- Status indicators
    security_status_indicator CHAR(2),
    
    -- Import tracking
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    
    WITH (
  tsdb.hypertable,
  tsdb.partition_column = 'data_date',
  tsdb.chunk_interval = '1 day',
  tsdb.segmentby = 'exchange, symbol',
  tsdb.orderby = 'data_date, time DESC',
  tsdb.create_default_indexes = false
);

```

### **Key Design Decisions**

1\. BIGINT for Nanosecond Timestamps  
Rather than trying to force nanosecond data into PostgreSQL’s microsecond-limited TIMESTAMPTZ, I stored the original TAQ timestamp format as BIGINT. This preserves full nanosecond precision while allowing efficient numeric operations.

2\. Separate Data Date Column  
Since TAQ files only contain intraday timestamps, I added an explicit `data_date` column populated from the filename. This serves as the primary partitioning dimension for TimescaleDB.

3\. Comprehensive NBBO Fields  
The schema captures both the triggering quote (from a specific exchange) and the resulting NBBO state, enabling complex market microstructure analysis.

4\. Hypertable

The schema includes the creation of a hypertable with space partitioning for optimal performance. Here we are partitioning on the data\_date column for 1 day chunks

  `WITH (`  
  `tsdb.hypertable,`  
  `tsdb.partition_column = 'data_date',`  
  `tsdb.chunk_interval = '1 day',`  
  `tsdb.segmentby = 'exchange, symbol',`  
  `tsdb.orderby = 'sequence_number, time DESC',`  
  `tsdb.create_default_indexes = false`  
`)`

### **TimescaleDB Optimization**

```

```

#### **Index creation**

```

-- Primary index for time-series queries
CREATE INDEX idx_taq_nbbo_data_date_time 
ON taq_nbbo (data_date, time);

-- Symbol-based queries (most common)
CREATE INDEX idx_taq_nbbo_symbol_data_date 
ON taq_nbbo (symbol, data_date, time);

-- Exchange-based analysis
CREATE INDEX idx_taq_nbbo_exchange_data_date 
ON taq_nbbo (exchange, data_date, time);

-- Sequence number for data integrity checks
CREATE INDEX idx_taq_nbbo_sequence 
ON taq_nbbo (data_date, sequence_number);

```

The hypertable configuration provides:

* Time-based partitioning by `data_date` (daily chunks)  
* No space partitioning (single partition optimized for single-SSD architecture)  
* Memory-optimized chunking targeting 25% of available RAM per active chunk

## **Implementation and Data Pipeline**

### **Data Processing Pipeline**

The raw TAQ files require preprocessing before loading:

* Remove headers and footers from TAQ file. The timescaledb-parallel-copy utility does have an option for skipping the header row as well.  
* Inject date column (extracted from filename)

This preprocessing step is crucial because:

* TAQ files include header and trailer records that aren’t data  
* Files don’t contain date information—only intraday timestamps  
* Adding the date via sed is much faster than database-side processing

### **High-Performance Loading with Parallel Copy**

We can save time and perform all these operations in one go utilizing gunzip and sed with sequential piping to timescaledb-parallel-copy

```

gunzip -c EQY_US_ALL_NBBO_20250102.gz   | sed '1d;$d; s/^/2025-01-02|/' | timescaledb-parallel-copy \
  --connection "host=localhost user=postgres sslmode=disable dbname=postgres" \
  --table taq_nbbo \
  --file "DATA_DATE_CLEAN_EQY_US_ALL_NBBO_20250102" \
  --workers 16 \
  --batch-size 50000 \
  --reporting-period 10s \
  --split "|" \
  --copy-options "CSV" \
  --columns "data_date,time,exchange,symbol,bid_price,bid_size,offer_price,offer_size,quote_condition,sequence_number,national_bbo_indicator,finra_bbo_indicator,finra_adf_mpid_indicator,quote_cancel_correction,source_of_quote,best_bid_quote_condition,best_bid_exchange,best_bid_price,best_bid_size,best_bid_finra_market_maker_id,best_offer_quote_condition,best_offer_exchange,best_offer_price,best_offer_size,best_offer_finra_market_maker_id,luld_bbo_indicator,nbbo_luld_indicator,sip_generated_message_identifier,participant_timestamp,finra_adf_timestamp,security_status_indicator"

```

### **Time Conversion Functions**

To handle the unique TAQ timestamp format, I created specialized conversion functions:

* Convert TAQ timestamp (HHMMSSxxxxxxxxx) to PostgreSQL timestamp

```

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ns_to_market_time(
    data_date DATE,
    taq_timestamp BIGINT,
    timezone_name TEXT DEFAULT 'America/New_York'
) RETURNS TIMESTAMPTZ AS $
DECLARE
    time_str TEXT;
    hours INTEGER;
    minutes INTEGER;
    seconds INTEGER;
    nanoseconds BIGINT;
    base_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ;
BEGIN
    -- Handle NULL or negative values
    IF taq_timestamp IS NULL OR taq_timestamp < 0 THEN
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;
    
    -- Convert BIGINT to 15-character string with leading zeros
    time_str := LPAD(taq_timestamp::TEXT, 15, '0');
    
    -- Validate format (should be exactly 15 characters)
    IF LENGTH(time_str) != 15 THEN
        RAISE WARNING 'Invalid timestamp length: % (length: %)', time_str, LENGTH(time_str);
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;
    
    -- Parse HHMMSSxxxxxxxxx format with error handling
    BEGIN
        hours := SUBSTRING(time_str, 1, 2)::INTEGER;
        minutes := SUBSTRING(time_str, 3, 2)::INTEGER;
        seconds := SUBSTRING(time_str, 5, 2)::INTEGER;
        nanoseconds := SUBSTRING(time_str, 7, 9)::BIGINT;
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE WARNING 'Failed to parse timestamp components from: %', time_str;
        RETURN NULL;
    END;
    
    -- Validate time components
    IF hours > 23 OR minutes > 59 OR seconds > 59 THEN
        RAISE WARNING 'Invalid time components: %:%:% from %', hours, minutes, seconds, time_str;
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;
    
    -- Create timestamp and add nanoseconds (as microseconds)
    BEGIN
        base_timestamp := (data_date +
            (hours || ' hours')::INTERVAL +
            (minutes || ' minutes')::INTERVAL +
            (seconds || ' seconds')::INTERVAL
        ) AT TIME ZONE timezone_name;
        
        -- Add nanoseconds (converted to microseconds for PostgreSQL)
        RETURN base_timestamp + (nanoseconds / 1000.0 || ' microseconds')::INTERVAL;
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE WARNING 'Failed to create timestamp for date: %, time: %:%:%', 
                     data_date, hours, minutes, seconds;
        RETURN NULL;
    END;
    
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE WARNING 'Unexpected error in ns_to_market_time: %', SQLERRM;
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE;

```

## **Advanced Features and Analysis Capabilities**

### **Data Quality Monitoring**

* Daily data validation function

```

SELECT * FROM validate_nbbo_data('2025-01-02');

-- Example output:
-- validation_check       | status | count_or_value | details
-- Total Records          | INFO   | 1,887,442,156  | Total NBBO records
-- NULL Required Fields   | PASS   | 0              | No NULL violations
-- Invalid Time Format    | PASS   | 0              | All timestamps valid
-- Unique Symbols         | INFO   | 8,547          | Number of symbols

```

### **Materialized View for Performance**

```

-- Daily summary statistics (refreshed after each load)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_nbbo_summary AS
SELECT 
    data_date,
    symbol,
    COUNT(*) as total_quotes,
    AVG(best_offer_price - best_bid_price) as avg_spread,
    MIN(best_offer_price - best_bid_price) as min_spread,
    MAX(best_offer_price - best_bid_price) as max_spread,
    COUNT(DISTINCT exchange) as exchange_count
FROM taq_nbbo
WHERE best_bid_price > 0 AND best_offer_price > 0
GROUP BY data_date, symbol;

```

## **Lessons Learned and Best Practices**

### **Key Technical Insights**

1\. Embrace Native Data Formats  
Rather than forcing TAQ’s nanosecond timestamps into PostgreSQL’s microsecond TIMESTAMPTZ, storing them as BIGINT and converting when needed proved much more efficient and preserved full precision.

2\. Preprocessing is Often Faster Than Database Processing  
Using sed to add the date column and clean files was dramatically faster than doing this processing in the database, even with PostgreSQL’s powerful text processing capabilities.

3\. Compression Strategy Matters  
TimescaleDB’s compression settings (`compress_orderby` and `compress_segmentby`) significantly impact both storage efficiency and query performance. Aligning these with actual access patterns was crucial.

4\. Indexing Pays Off  
Indexing by symbol in addition to time provided significant query performance improvements for symbol-specific analysis, which is extremely common in financial research.

### **Common Pitfalls and Solutions**

1\. Index and Hypertable Strategy During Loads  
Initially, I tried to maintain indexes during bulk loads along with inserting the data into a hypertable, which severely impacted performance. Despite using `timescaledb-parallel-copy` the load times went from under ten minutes to hours, with sub 200k row/sec performance being the norm. For massive datasets like TAQ, dropping indexes during loads—and converting to a hypertable post load afterward—is essential.

2\. Timezone Handling Complexity  
TAQ timestamps are in Eastern Time, but storing them as naive timestamps and converting to specific timezones at query time proved most flexible.

3\. Robust Error Handling  
The TAQ timestamp parsing function includes comprehensive error handling and validation. Rather than silently failing on malformed data, it provides detailed warnings for debugging while gracefully handling edge cases.

## **Conclusion**

This project fundamentally transformed how we analyze market microstructure data. What previously required overnight batch processing now completes within an hour of receiving daily TAQ files, enabling much faster research iterations and more responsive market analysis.

The combination of TimescaleDB’s time-series optimizations with careful schema design created a system that processes billions of records efficiently while maintaining nanosecond precision—critical for regulatory compliance and market microstructure research.

Key Impact Metrics:

* Fast daily processing (\~57 minutes)  
* Fast query performance with indexing  
* Full nanosecond precision maintained for regulatory compliance  
* Enabled same-day analysis of market microstructure data

The foundation built with TimescaleDB is robust and scalable. It can support growing analytical needs while maintaining amazing query performance. For anyone working with high-frequency financial time-series data, TimescaleDB provides an exceptional balance of familiar SQL interfaces, specialized time-series optimizations, and enterprise-grade reliability.

Financial markets generate some of the most demanding time-series datasets in terms of volume, precision, and performance requirements. This project demonstrates that with proper schema design and the right tools, even the most challenging datasets can be tamed to provide fast, reliable analytics at scale.
